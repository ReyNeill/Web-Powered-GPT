# Local AI Model on Browser with Web-Workers

Just a little thing using HTML, CSS and in-line JavaScript to load a local AI model on the browser using web-llm and Web Workers.

## Prerequisites

Just install node:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Server

To run the local server and use the application, follow these steps:

1. Start the server locally by running the following command in the project directory:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to:

   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. You should now see the chat interface. Wait for the model to load (this may take a few seconds), and you can start interacting with the AI. Customize at will.
